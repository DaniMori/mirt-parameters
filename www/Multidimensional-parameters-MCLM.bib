A qualidade de um website engloba características técnicas (usabilidade/navegabilidade, apresentação da informação e interatividade) e não técnicas (design, estética, apelo visual, confiabilidade, hedonismo, imagem), configurando-se, teoricamente, como contexto multidimensional. As suposições iniciais das dimensões e elaboração dos itens foram baseadas em análise bibliográfica sobre o tema qualidade em websites de e-commerce. Um conjunto de 75 itens foi elaborado e uma amostra de 441 websites de e-commerce dos mais variados setores foi a ele submetido. O tratamento e análise dos dados foram feitos utilizando-se a TRI. Nessa etapa, foram discutidas questões referentes à dimensionalidade e à escolha do modelo mais adequado. Por fim, um modelo multidimensional com quatro dimensões foi ajustado contemplando as dimensões navegabilidade ou condução/orientação do usuário, acessibilidade e confiabilidade do sistema, interatividade e apresentação da informação.},

An application to a large sample of data for twenty vocabulary items shows excellent fit of the model according to a chi-square criterion. Item and test information curves are compared for estimation of ability assuming multiple category and dichotomous scoring of these items. Multiple scoring proves substantially more precise for subjects of less than median ability, and about equally precise for subjects above the median.},

The independent clusters basis serves to determine dimensionality, while establishing a pattern for the item parameter matrix that provides identifiability conditions and facilitates interpretation of the traits. It also provides a natural extension of known results on convergent/discriminant “construct” validity to binary items, allowing the quantification of the validity of test and subtest scores. The independent-clusters basis simplifies item/test response and information hypersurfaces, which cannot otherwise be easily studied except in the trivial case of two dimensions, and provides estimates of latent traits with uncorrelated measurement errors. In addition, the affine transformation needed for the informative analysis of the causes of differential item functioning is simplified using the independent-clusters basis. These classically based procedures are already well-established in the context of the linear commonfactor model and, accordingly, they set a standard against which more recently developed procedures for the same purposes need to be judged.},

Over the past decades, two such models have become most widely used: the Five Factor Model (FFM) or Big Five, respectively, and the HEXACO Model of Personality. However, there is no large-scale empirical evidence on the general comparability of these models. Here, we provide the first comprehensive meta-analysis on (a) the correspondence of the FFM/Big Five and HEXACO dimensions, (b) the scope of trait content the models cover, and (c) the orthogonality (i.e., degree of independence) of dimensions within the models. Results based on 152 (published and unpublished) samples and 6,828 unique effects showed that the HEXACO dimensions incorporate notable conceptual differences compared to the FFM/Big Five dimensions, resulting in a broader coverage of the personality space and less redundancy between dimensions. Moreover, moderator analyses revealed substantial differences between operationalizations of the FFM/Big Five. Taken together, these findings have important theoretical and practical implications for the understanding of basic personality dimensions and their assessment.},

Much literature has demonstrated the presence of positive and negative keying factors in low-stakes testing situations, but there is a dearth of research investigating these factors in high-stakes testing. To address this gap, we investigated whether an FFM measure used in high-stakes testing was influenced by positive and negative keying factors. We also examined the overlap of the positive and negative keying factors with social desirability, rule-consciousness, acquiescence, and cognitive ability. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the inclusion of distinct factors associated with positively and negatively keyed items and suggested that the keying factors accounted for a substantial portion of variation in responses to FFM items. Social desirability and rule-consciousness were found to have significant relations with both keying factors, whereas acquiescence was only related to the negative keying factor. Implications for the construct validity of FFM measures used in high-stakes testing and directions for future research are discussed.},

To satisfy the tetrad-difference criterion the tests must be so selected as to have only one factor in common, for this criterion merely shows whether or not any given set of intercorrelations can be described in terms of only one common factor. The multiple-factor method of analysis, which recognizes the possibility of group factors and attempts to determine the smallest number that must be postulated to account for the differentiable human traits, of which the tetrad difference method is a special case, is described. Several specific studies of personality, in which the multiple-factor method have been used, are described; one on a list of sixty adjectives descriptive of personality, which yielded five group factors; one on the insanities, in which the whole range of psychotic symptoms reduced to five clusters; another on the vocational interests of college students; and a fourth on radicalism as a common factor. The multiple-factor analysis has been applied to two sets of data used by Spearman's students in support of the single-factor hypothesis. Both turn out to reduce to two common factors. It is suggested that an adequate multiple-factor analysis of mental abilities will probably yield at least three distinct though correlated factors—verbal ability, perceptual relations, and arithmetical ability; also that the isolation of mental abilities will turn out to be a problem in genetics.
