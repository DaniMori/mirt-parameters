	abstract = {A multivariate logistic latent trait model for items scored in two or more nominal categories is proposed. Statistical methods based on the model provide 1) estimation of two item parameters for each response alternative of each multiple choice item and 2) recovery of information from “wrong” responses when estimating latent ability. An application to a large sample of data for twenty vocabulary items shows excellent fit of the model according to a chi-square criterion. Item and test information curves are compared for estimation of ability assuming multiple category and dichotomous scoring of these items. Multiple scoring proves substantially more precise for subjects of less than median ability, and about equally precise for subjects above the median.},

As suposições iniciais das dimensões e elaboração dos itens foram baseadas em análise bibliográfica sobre o tema qualidade em websites de e-commerce. Um conjunto de 75 itens foi elaborado e uma amostra de 441 websites de e-commerce dos mais variados setores foi a ele submetido. O tratamento e análise dos dados foram feitos utilizando-se a TRI. Nessa etapa, foram discutidas questões referentes à dimensionalidade e à escolha do modelo mais adequado. Por fim, um modelo multidimensional com quatro dimensões foi ajustado contemplando as dimensões navegabilidade ou condução/orientação do usuário, acessibilidade e confiabilidade do sistema, interatividade e apresentação da informação.},

The independent clusters basis serves to determine dimensionality, while establishing a pattern for the item parameter matrix that provides identifiability conditions and facilitates interpretation of the traits. It also provides a natural extension of known results on convergent/discriminant “construct” validity to binary items, allowing the quantification of the validity of test and subtest scores. The independent-clusters basis simplifies item/test response and information hypersurfaces, which cannot otherwise be easily studied except in the trivial case of two dimensions, and provides estimates of latent traits with uncorrelated measurement errors. In addition, the affine transformation needed for the informative analysis of the causes of differential item functioning is simplified using the independent-clusters basis. These classically based procedures are already well-established in the context of the linear commonfactor model and, accordingly, they set a standard against which more recently developed procedures for the same purposes need to be judged.},

	abstract = {Models of basic personality structure are among the most widely used frameworks in psychology and beyond, and they have considerably advanced the understanding of individual differences in a plethora of consequential outcomes. Over the past decades, two such models have become most widely used: the Five Factor Model (FFM) or Big Five, respectively, and the HEXACO Model of Personality. However, there is no large-scale empirical evidence on the general comparability of these models. Here, we provide the first comprehensive meta-analysis on (a) the correspondence of the FFM/Big Five and HEXACO dimensions, (b) the scope of trait content the models cover, and (c) the orthogonality (i.e., degree of independence) of dimensions within the models. Results based on 152 (published and unpublished) samples and 6,828 unique effects showed that the HEXACO dimensions incorporate notable conceptual differences compared to the FFM/Big Five dimensions, resulting in a broader coverage of the personality space and less redundancy between dimensions. Moreover, moderator analyses revealed substantial differences between operationalizations of the FFM/Big Five. Taken together, these findings have important theoretical and practical implications for the understanding of basic personality dimensions and their assessment.},

Much literature has demonstrated the presence of positive and negative keying factors in low-stakes testing situations, but there is a dearth of research investigating these factors in high-stakes testing. To address this gap, we investigated whether an FFM measure used in high-stakes testing was influenced by positive and negative keying factors. We also examined the overlap of the positive and negative keying factors with social desirability, rule-consciousness, acquiescence, and cognitive ability. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the inclusion of distinct factors associated with positively and negatively keyed items and suggested that the keying factors accounted for a substantial portion of variation in responses to FFM items. Social desirability and rule-consciousness were found to have significant relations with both keying factors, whereas acquiescence was only related to the negative keying factor. Implications for the construct validity of FFM measures used in high-stakes testing and directions for future research are discussed.},
