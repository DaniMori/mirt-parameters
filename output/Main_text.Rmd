# Abstract

In this paper, we generalize the multidimensional discrimination (MDISC) and
difficulty (MID) parameters in the Multidimensional 2-Parameter Logistic model
to account for non-identity latent covariances and negatively-keyed items.
We apply Reckase's maximum discrimination point method to define them in an
arbitrary algebraic basis.
Then, we define such basis to be a
geometrical representation of the measured construct.
This results in three different versions of the parameters: The original one,
based on the item parameters solely, one that incorporates the covariance
structure of the latent space, and one that uses the correlation structure
instead. Importantly, we find that the items should be properly represented in
a test space, distinct from the latent space.
We also provide a procedure for the geometrical representation of the items in
the test space, and apply our results to examples from the literature to get a
more accurate representation of the measurement properties of the items.
We recommend using the covariance structure version for describing the
properties of the parameters, and the correlation structure version for
graphical representation.
Finally, we discuss the implications of this generalization for other
multidimensional IRT models and the parallels of our results in common factor
model theory.

# A Generalized Definition of Multidimensional Item Response Theory Parameters

Multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) models have been widely used since
their inception.
The so-called *Multidimensional 2-Parameter Logistic*
[`r MODEL_ACRONYM`, @mckinley_extension_1983] model is among the most important
and widely used ones.
This is partly due to its close relationship to the common factor model
[@mcdonald_test_1999], but also to the formal tractability of its formulation.
It consists of a generalization of the 2-parameter logistic model
[@birnbaum_latent_1968] to more than one latent trait
[@mckinley_extension_1983].
Its usefulness lies in describing the variability of the population when
the correct response does not depend on a single trait;
more specifically, when a deficit in a certain trait
and a surplus in another one cancel out their effects. Because of this property,
it is sometimes referred to as a *compensatory* model.

@reckase_difficulty_1985 argues for a need to take dimensionality into account
when characterizing the statistical properties of multidimensional items.
As such, he outlines a general procedure for determining their difficulty.
Following this procedure, he also derives
a *multidimensional difficulty* parameter (MID) for `r MODEL_ACRONYM` items.
This parameter consists of two parts:
The first one is a scalar value representing the distance from
the origin of the multidimensional latent space to
the maximally discriminating locus of the item;
the second one, the direction of the vector from the origin to that same locus.
Following a similar rationale, @reckase_discriminating_1991 derive a
*multidimensional discrimination* (`r MDISC_SYM`) parameter definition
for that model.

A crucial assumption leading to those formulations is that the axes of the
latent space are orthogonal
[@ackerman_using_1994; @ackerman_multidimensional_2005; see also
@reckase_difficulty_1985, p. 404 and Equation 7].
Of course, orthogonality is a property of a geometrical space instead of a
latent trait space.
Thus, nothing prevents a researcher from interpreting an abstraction such as
a latent trait space, no matter its structure, as an orthogonal space
---exploratory factor analysis software, such as SPSS [@ibm_corp_ibm_2022] or
the R package *psych* [@revelle_psych_2024], graphically represents
factor loadings on orthogonal axes even after an oblique rotation.
Nevertheless, the assimilation of correlated latent traits to non-orthogonal
axes is prevalent in the common factor literature
[see, e.g., @harman_modern_1976]:
Indeed, the cosine between any two axes (or, more generally, vectors)
is considered as the geometrical equivalent of the correlation between
the variables they represent.
This assumption is not so easily found in the MIRT literature though,
which mostly deals with uncorrelated dimensions
[see @reckase_multidimensional_2009 for a comprehensive treatment of the topic].
This fact is probably due to the different aspects
these two theoretical programs put the focus on;
factor analysis aims at a clear interpretation of
the latent covariance structure, and thus focuses on finding
a structure matrix as simple as possible.
The MIRT literature, on the other hand,
intends to model responses to certain stimuli and estimate person scores,
with model interpretation secondary in relevance.
Nevertheless, the confluence of the two theoretical approaches into a common
modern measurement theory [@mcdonald_test_1999] requires
the relaxation of traditional constraints on both approaches.
It is not uncommon to find recent examples of MIRT models where the
correlation matrix of the latent dimensions is freely estimated
[see, e.g., @reckase_multidimensional_2009, pp. 224-228]. Despite this, the
correspondence between correlated latent traits and orthogonal coordinate axes
is usually implicit in the MIRT literature without further consideration
[see @zhang_theoretical_1999 for a notable exception].
Moreover, disregarding this geometrical interpretation may lead to
critical misconceptions about the measurement model.

Take the following as an example:
A hypothetical complex item measures two latent traits with equal validity
---i.e., its discrimination parameters are equal with value $`r DISCR_SYM`$.
Applying Reckase & McKinley's [-@reckase_discriminating_1991] formula,
we would find that $`r AG_MDISC_EXAMPLE`$.
Assume we apply this item in two groups where, taken to the extreme,
the two measured dimensions are orthogonal in the first group
and perfectly correlated in the second one.
While the previous formula seems correct in the first group,
one can intuitively say that,
because the two dimensions are *perfectly aligned* in the second group,
the item `r MDISC_SYM` should be the algebraic sum of both components,
that is, $`r MDISC_VALUE_COLLIN`$.
Similarly, the correlation between two simple items,
each one measuring a distinct dimension,
should be uncorrelated in the first group,
but perfectly correlated in the second one.
As the cosine between variables is usually understood as
the geometrical representation of their correlation,
the cosine between the two items should be 1 in the second group.
However, using an orthogonal representation
would yield null cosines in both cases.

Therefore, the representation of a latent space where the traits are correlated
is more accurate on a geometrical coordinate system with non-orthogonal axes
[@ackerman_multidimensional_2005-1, p. 16, see footnote 1]
and (possibly) non-standard units,
often referred to as *general Cartesian coordinates*
[@harman_modern_1976, p. 60].
Such a space has the advantage that the basis vectors and the axes they yield
have a meaningful interpretation (albeit counterintuitive, as we will see)
in a multivariate statistical sense.
The general case of MIRT model estimation implies estimating possibly
non-standard latent dimensions and non-null covariances among them
(a more realistic case than an identity matrix).
Assuming orthonormality among traits is usually unrealistic, be it in the
cognitive [e.g., @reckase_multidimensional_2009] or the non-cognitive domain
[e.g., @thielmann_comparability_2022].
Moreover, certain applications impose the estimation of
non-identity latent covariance matrices (e.g., multi-group equating) even when
interpreting the latent dimensions as substantive constructs is not a goal
[for multidimensional linking and equating procedures,
see Chapter 9 in @reckase_multidimensional_2009].
As we will argue, the usual definitions of the multidimensional difficulty and
discrimination parameters do not generalize to the non-orthonormal geometry
necessary to accurately represent correlated latent spaces.

Negative loadings/discrimination parameters
are often irrelevant in MIRT applications in the cognitive testing domain.
It has been argued that discrimination parameters
"are constrained to be positive" [@ackerman_graphical_1996, p. 315],
or that "in an [independent-clusters] solution, the loadings can always
be selected to be positive" [@mcdonald_basis_2000, p. 110].
However, when such instances of negative parameters appear,
they are often dismissed as "particularly puzzling" (p. 109),
or implicitly assuming item malfunctioning without further discussion
[e.g., @ackerman_multidimensional_2005-1].
In the non-cognitive domain though, the use of so-called negatively-keyed items
---items that tap the negative pole of a certain trait, and thus
usually reverse-scored--- is widespread
[consider, e.g., the statement "Neglect my duties" in the Conscientiousness item
of the Big-Five Factor Markers, @noauthor_international_nodate].
Instruments that combine positively- and negatively-keyed items
are relatively common, and
complex indicators may even have discrimination parameters
with opposite signs for different latent dimensions
[see, e.g., @mclarnon_be_2016,
for item parcels with both positive and negative loadings,
on method factors in the case of the negative ones].
Following @ackerman_multidimensional_2005-1, one can easily note that
a monotonically decreasing probability for a certain dimension
is given by a non-positive discrimination parameter
(and an unchanging probability by a null discrimination parameter,
which also applies to cognitive instruments),
contrary to the constraints imposed by @reckase_difficulty_1985 [p. 411]
for determining the multidimensional difficulty.
However, the multidimensional item parameters can also be defined for
items with monotonically non-increasing probabilities, as we will see.

The main objective of this paper is thus to provide a generalization of
the MIRT parameters in two aspects: on one hand, in an oblique coordinate system
that can be soundly applied to the correlated trait case; on the other, to
items that yield monotonic response probabilities, but in the broader sense of
unchanging monotonicity. Additionally, we aim to provide a method for
graphically representing these items in the fashion of @ackerman_creating_1994
but taking the non-orthogonality of the coordinate axes into account.
To pursue these objectives, we first define the generalization of
the `r MODEL_ACRONYM` model and describe its scope of application,
which will require introducing some linear algebra concepts and results.
Then, we follow the method outlined by @reckase_difficulty_1985 and
@reckase_discriminating_1991 to obtain
the formulation of the multidimensional parameters.
We will introduce three different versions,
showing that either the original or one of the new ones is obtained
as a function of how we define and interpret the latent space.
[Interestingly, we will show that, when the latent space basis is defined
as a geometric mapping of the covariance structure,
we arrive at a definition of the norm that is given by
the @mahalanobis_reprint_2018, distance.]
Next, we discuss their properties,
propose a graphical representation method based on the new formulation,
and present two examples of application of our results.
These examples, from the cognitive and the non-cognitive domain, respectively,
are taken from the MIRT literature:
One of them is a classic dataset, often used to exemplify
the use of the `r MODEL_ACRONYM` model [@reckase_multidimensional_2009];
the other one, an application in marketing research [@tezza_modelo_2018].
We conclude with a discussion about
the applicability and generalization of our results.

# Model Formulation

Consider a basis $`r LS_BASIS_EQ`$,
with $`r LS_BASIS`$ not necessarily orthonormal.
Let $`r LATENT_SPACE`$ be a $`r N_DIMS`$-dimensional latent space
in basis $`r LS_BASIS`$ (with $`r N_DIMS`$ any positive integer),
where a respondent is represented by vector $`r TRAIT_VEC_IN_LS`$.
According to the `r MODEL_ACRONYM` model, the probability of
a positive response to item $`r ITEM_INDEX`$ is

\begin{equation}
  `r M2PL_FORMULATION`,                                  (\#eq:M2PL-formulation)
\end{equation}

where $`r DISCR_VECTOR`$ is an $`r N_DIMS`$-dimensional vector of discrimination
parameters, and $`r INTERCEPT_PARAM`$ an intercept parameter related to the
location of the item in the latent space.

We pause here for a few remarks. First, as we are not constraining
ourselves to cognitive traits,
we speak of _positive_ instead of _correct response_. This may imply giving
a correct response indeed, if we are talking about a cognitive test.
But it may mean endorsing an item (or a certain response option)
in a non-cognitive domain.
Second, as responses are not necessarily interpreted as correct or incorrect,
parameter $`r INTERCEPT_PARAM`$ is said to be related to the item _location_
instead of the item difficulty.
Third, although not explicitly stated, $`r DISCR_VECTOR`$ is a vector of
non-negative real numbers in @reckase_difficulty_1985
---a decrease in the probability of a correct response
with an increase in ability makes little sense.
In our case, $`r DISCR_VECTOR`$ is a vector of real numbers; the value
of the $`r DIM_INDEX`$-th component $`r DISCR_PARAM`$ can be negative if
the item is negatively-keyed for latent dimension $`r DIM_INDEX`$.
Fourth, $`r DISCR_VECTOR`$ is expressed in some algebraic basis,
which the MIRT literature implicitly assumes to be the canonical basis
(and also the same as $`r LS_BASIS`$;
we will show that neither of these assumptions is necessary though).
Finally, it is worth highlighting that
this model generally assumes *within-item multidimensionality*,
which will be present whenever more than one component of $`r DISCR_VECTOR`$
is non-null.
However, the model can also account for *between-item multidimensionality*
if the $`r DISCR_VECTOR`$ parameter only has one non-null component.

Following Reckase's [-@reckase_difficulty_1985] procedure,
we must find in the first place
the point of maximum slope of $`r IRF_ABBR`$ in $`r LATENT_SPACE`$.
Because the slope is dependent on the direction considered,
we need to reparameterize Equation \@ref(eq:M2PL-formulation)
in polar coordinates, as in @reckase_difficulty_1985.
However, Reckase's Equation 3 implicitly assumes orthogonality.
To contemplate the general case,
we need to introduce a few linear algebra results before proceeding further.

# Linear Algebra of Non-Orthogonal Coordinates

Let's consider an orthonormal basis $`r LS_ORTH_BASIS_EQ`$ in $`r LATENT_SPACE`$
with the dot product as inner product.
Let $`r TRAIT_COORDS_EQ`$ and $`r TRAIT_COORDS_ORTH_EQ`$ be the coordinates of
any $`r TRAIT_VEC_IN_LS`$ in $`r LS_BASIS`$ and $`r LS_ORTH_BASIS`$,
respectively, such that $`r TRAIT_VECTOR_DEF_EQ`$.
That is, the geometric representation of the algebraic vector $`r TRAIT_VECTOR`$
in each of the two bases is given by the linear combination of
the element vectors of the basis,
scaled by the coordinates of $`r TRAIT_VECTOR`$ in that basis.
However, note that, as $`r LATENT_SPACE`$ is originally represented in
$`r LS_BASIS`$, the geometric coordinates $`r TRAIT_COORDS`$ of
$`r TRAIT_VECTOR`$ in $`r LS_BASIS`$ are equal to the algebraic ones, i.e.,
in Equation \@ref(eq:M2PL-formulation) we identify $`r TRAIT_GEOM_ALGEBR_EQ`$.

Let $`r BASIS_CHANGE_DEF`$ be the change of basis matrix between the two bases;
then, we have that

\begin{equation}
  `r BASIS_CHANGE`.                                          (\#eq:change-basis)
\end{equation}

The $`r DIM_INDEX`$-th column of $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX`$ is given by the
coordinates of $`r BASIS_VECTOR_ANY`$ in basis $`r LS_ORTH_BASIS`$;
formally, if $`r BASIS_VECTOR_ANY_TRANSF_EQ`$, then

\begin{equation}
  `r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_EQ`.                           (\#eq:transform-matrix-def)
\end{equation}

As the norm of $`r TRAIT_VECTOR`$ must be invariant (i.e., $`r TRAIT_NORM_EQ`$),
we need to define $`r LS_BASIS`$ in $`r LATENT_SPACE`$ with inner product
$`r LS_BASIS_INNER_PROD`$ as

\begin{equation}
  `r TRAIT_NORM_SQ_EQ`.                                 (\#eq:inner-product-def)
\end{equation}

Thus, inner product $`r LS_BASIS_INNER_PROD`$ has $`r INNER_PROD_MAT_EQ`$ as its
Gram matrix, i.e., $`r INNER_PROD_EQ`$, with $`r INNER_PROD_MAT_ELEMENT_EQ`$ as
the $`r INNER_PROD_MATRIX_INDEX`$-th element of $`r INNER_PROD_MATRIX`$.

## Test Space Definition

Let $`r TEST_SPACE`$ be the vector space made up by
the set of $`r DISCR_VECTOR`$ vectors,
with the operations sum and product by a scalar as in $`r REAL_N_SPACE`$.
We want Reckase's [-@reckase_difficulty_1985] definition of
the multidimensional parameters in rectangular coordinates to be
a particular case of our more general definition;
we can thus consider an orthonormal basis $`r TEST_SPACE_STD_BASIS`$
in $`r TEST_SPACE`$ such that $`r DISCR_STD_COORDS_ALT_EQ`$
corresponds in the model to $`r TRAIT_ORTH_COORDS`$.
Since the response probability to the `r MODEL_ACRONYM`,
given by Equation \@ref(eq:M2PL-formulation), must be invariant with respect to
the change of basis expressed in Equation \@ref(eq:change-basis),
$`r INVARIANCE_EQ`$.
Therefore, we find a basis $`r TEST_SPACE_BASIS_EQ`$ in $`r TEST_SPACE`$
defined by

\begin{equation}
  `r DISCR_STD_COORDS_EQ`,                               (\#eq:discr-vector-std)
\end{equation}

with $`r DISCR_COORDS_ALT_EQ`$, and
$`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_TRANSP_INV`$ a change of basis matrix.
Note that $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_TRANSP_INV`$ determines $`r TEST_SPACE_BASIS`$
and, as $`r DISCR_VECTOR`$ is expressed in this basis,
its geometric coordinates in $`r TEST_SPACE_BASIS`$
are equal to its algebraic ones,
i.e., in Equation \@ref(eq:M2PL-formulation) we identify
$`r DISCR_VECTOR_COORDS_EQ`$.

As we did with $`r LS_ORTH_BASIS`$ before,
we can conveniently assume that the inner product in
$`r TEST_SPACE_STD_BASIS`$ is the dot product.
Then, as both $`r TEST_SPACE_STD_BASIS`$ and $`r LS_ORTH_BASIS`$ are
orthonormal in $`r REAL_N_SPACE`$,
to make Reckase's [-@reckase_difficulty_1985] definition
a particular case of ours we can,
without loss of generality  (i.e., applying an arbitrary rotation),
consider that $`r BASES_EQ`$.
As $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX`$ (and consequently $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_TRANSP`$) is
invertible, so $`r INNER_PROD_MATRIX`$ is, and $`r INNER_PROD_MATRIX_INV_EQ`$.
The norm of $`r DISCR_VECTOR`$ thus fulfills

\begin{equation}
  `r DISCR_VECTOR_MODULE_EQ`.
\end{equation}

Therefore, an inner product $`r TEST_SPACE_INNER_PROD`$ with Gram matrix
$`r INNER_PROD_MATRIX_INV`$ can be defined, such that $`r INNER_PROD_DISCR_EQ`$
keeps the norm of $`r DISCR_VECTOR`$ invariant.
Following @zhang_theoretical_1999, we shall refer to space $`r TEST_SPACE`$ as
the *test space*, as it is the space where
the items (i.e., the test elements) are represented.

## Direction Cosines in the Latent Space

The cosine between two vectors

\begin{equation}
  `r COS_VECTORS_EQ`,                                         (\#eq:cos-vectors)
\end{equation}

is independent of whether the inner product is standard or not.
Therefore, to compute the direction cosine $`r DIR_COS_ANY_ORG`$
of vector $`r TRAIT_VECTOR`$ along dimension $`r DIM_INDEX`$,
we plug it into Equation \@ref(eq:cos-vectors) along with
the corresponding basis vector $`r BASIS_VECTOR_ANY`$:

\begin{equation}
  `r DIR_COSINE_EQ`.                                     (\#eq:direction-cosine)
\end{equation}

Let's consider now the vector $`r DIR_COS_VEC_ORG`$, made up by the $`r N_DIMS`$
direction cosines of $`r TRAIT_VECTOR`$ with
the basis vectors of $`r LS_BASIS`$.

::: {#prp-dir-cosines-generalized-basis}

**Proposition 1** Under the previously defined conditions, for all
$`r TRAIT_VEC_IN_LS`$,

\end{equation}

with

\begin{equation}
  `r DIAG_MATRIX_INNER_PROD_EQ`.

Therefore,

Therefore, $`r DIR_COS_VEC_EQ`$ and $`r TRAIT_VECTOR_POLAR_EQ`$.

We can also obtain a result that relates the direction cosines of any two bases.

::: {#prp-dir-cosines-bases-relationship}

**Proposition 2** Let's consider another basis $`r ALT_BASIS_EQ`$ in
$`r LATENT_SPACE`$ and the inner product $`r ALT_BASIS_INNER_PROD`$ that keeps
the norm of the space invariant.


Let $`r DIR_COS_VEC_STD`$ and $`r DIR_COS_VEC_ALT`$ be the vectors of
direction cosines of $`r TRAIT_VECTOR`$ in $`r LS_ORTH_BASIS`$ and
$`r ALT_BASIS`$, respectively.

Then,

\begin{equation}
  `r DIR_COS_VEC_ALT_EQ`,                      (\#eq:dir-cosines-transformation)
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
  `r DIAG_MATRIX_INNER_PROD_ALT_EQ`
\end{equation}

and $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_ALT_EQ`$.

::: {.proof}
*Proof.*

Let's call $`r TRAIT_COORDS_ALT_EQ`$ and let $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_ALT_EQ`$
be the change of basis matrix, such that $`r TRAIT_TRANSFORM_ALT_EQ`$.

Then, we have that $`r BASIS_CHANGE_ORG_ALT_EQ`$. 

The inner product $`r ALT_BASIS_INNER_PROD`$ that keeps the norm invariant is
defined by $`r INNER_PROD_TRAIT_ALT_EQ`$, and we define
$`r INNER_PROD_MATRIX_ALT_EQ`$.

By proposition 1, for each case we have:

i. $`r TRAIT_VEC_ORTH_POLAR_EQ`$

i. $`r TRAIT_VECTOR_POLAR_EQ`$

i. $`r TRAIT_VEC_ALT_POLAR_EQ`$

Given i,

\begin{equation}
  `r TRAIT_VEC_ORTH_POLAR_EQ_XPAND`
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
  `r TRAIT_VEC_ALT_POLAR_ALT_EQ`.
\end{equation}

Using ii and iii we get that

\begin{equation}
  `r TRAIT_VEC_ORTH_POLAR_ORG_EQ`
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
  `r TRAIT_VEC_ORTH_POLAR_ALT_EQ`.
\end{equation}

Therefore,

\begin{equation}
  `r TRAIT_VEC_POLAR_ORG_ALT_COEFF_EQ`,
\end{equation}

and thus $`r DIR_COS_VEC_ALT_EQ`$.$`r END_OF_PROOF`$

# Model Recasting Into Polar Coordinates

Applying Proposition 1 to
the model formulation in Equation \@ref(eq:M2PL-formulation),
the `r MODEL_ACRONYM` model is expressed in polar coordinates as

\begin{equation}
  `r IRF_POLAR_EQ`.                                    (\#eq:M2PL-formula-polar)
\end{equation}

As Equation \@ref(eq:M2PL-formula-polar) shows, the inner product matrix is
involved in the expression of the model in polar coordinates.
Importantly, this shows that
Reckase's [-@reckase_difficulty_1985] Equation 3 (p. 403)
assumes the orthonormality of the latent space, as we stated before.

# Point of Maximum Slope

Following the procedure outlined by @reckase_difficulty_1985
[@reckase_discriminating_1991],
we first compute the point of maximum slope by finding the root(s) of
the second derivative with respect to $`r TRAIT_NORM`$.

The slope in direction $`r DIR_ANGLE_VEC_ORG`$ is given by

\begin{equation}
  `r IRF_1ST_DIFF_EQ`,                                      (\#eq:M2PL-1st-diff)
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
  `r IRF_2ND_DIFF_EQ`,                                      (\#eq:M2PL-2nd-diff)
\end{equation}

The root we are interested in is found for $`r IRF_MAX_SLOPE_EQ`$
(the other ones occur when $`r IRF_ABBR`$ equals 0 and 1,
which result in improper values of $`r TRAIT_NORM`$).

The slope in direction $`r DIR_ANGLE_ITEM_VEC_EQ`$ when $`r IRF_MAX_SLOPE_EQ`$
is given by

\begin{equation}
  `r SLOPE_MAX_EQ`.                                             (\#eq:slope-max)
\end{equation}

Notation aside, these equations differ from
Reckase's [-@reckase_difficulty_1985] Equations 3 through 6
only in the term $`r INNER_PROD_INV_DIAG_SQ_PROD`$.

To compute the direction of the maximum slope,
Reckase leverages the property that
the sum of the squared direction cosines equals 1 (see Equation 7 therein).
However, this assertion implicitly assumes orthogonal coordinates,
so it does not apply in general to $`r DIR_COS_VEC_ORG`$.
Instead, we may consider the direction cosine vector with an orthonormal basis
$`r LS_ORTH_BASIS`$.
Now, applying Proposition 2 (with both $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_ALT`$ and
$`r DIAG_MATRIX_INNER_PROD_ALT`$ equal to the identity matrix) we obtain

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    `r DIR_COS_AS_DIR_COS_ORTH_EQ`, \\
    `r TRAIT_POLAR_COEFF_COS_ORTH_EQ`.
  \end{split}                                 (\#eq:direction-cosine-vectors-eq)
\end{equation}

Therefore, substituting in \@ref(eq:slope-max),

\begin{equation}
  `r SLOPE_MAX_STD_COSINES_EQ`                      (\#eq:slope-max-std-cosines)
\end{equation}

and, by Equation \@ref(eq:discr-vector-std),

\begin{equation}
  `r SLOPE_MAX_STD_EQ`.                                     (\#eq:slope-max-std)
\end{equation}

We are thus considering the direction cosines with respect to the orthonormal
axes, so we can just apply Reckase's [-@reckase_difficulty_1985] results,
obtaining

\begin{equation}
  `r DIR_COS_VEC_STD_EQ`.                                 (\#eq:dir-cos-vec-std)
\end{equation}

Substituting $`r DIR_COS_ITEM_VEC_STD`$
(Equation \@ref(eq:direction-cosine-vectors-eq)) and
$`r DISCR_STD_COORDS`$ (Equation \@ref(eq:discr-vector-std))
by their respective expressions results in the
expression for the direction cosine vector of item $i$ in $`r LATENT_SPACE`$,

\begin{equation}
  `r DIR_COS_ITEM_VEC_EQ`,                                    (\#eq:dir-cos-vec)
\end{equation}

which gives the direction from the origin to the point where
the slope is maximum.
Finally, to determine the signed distance $`r DISTANCE_PARAM`$
from the origin to that point,
we solve Equation \@ref(eq:M2PL-formula-polar) for $`r IRF_MAX_SLOPE_EQ`$ to get
$`r TRAIT_NORM_SOLVED_EQ`$. Using equation \@ref(eq:dir-cos-vec),

\begin{equation}
  `r DISTANCE_PARAM_EQ`.                                   (\#eq:distance-param)
\end{equation}

The slope $`r SLOPE_MAX_PARAM`$ at the point defined by Equations
\@ref(eq:dir-cos-vec) and \@ref(eq:distance-param)
is given by Equation \@ref(eq:slope-max).
Substituting Equation \@ref(eq:dir-cos-vec) in Equation \@ref(eq:slope-max),
[@reckase_discriminating_1991],

\begin{equation}
  `r SLOPE_MAX_PARAM_EQ`,                                     (\#eq:slope-param)
\end{equation}

and thus, we have that

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    `r DIR_COS_ITEM_VEC_NORM_EQ` \\
    `r DISTANCE_PARAM_NORM_EQ`   \\
    `r SLOPE_MAX_PARAM_NORM_EQ`.
  \end{split}                             (\#eq:item-params-discrimination-norm)
\end{equation}

# Relationship Between Test Space and Latent Space

Before presenting the results about the parameters,
we make a few remarks regarding the vector space $`r TEST_SPACE`$.
As shown before, this space is an entity by itself,
distinct from the latent space $`r LATENT_SPACE`$.
Despite this, the dot product in the exponent of Equation
\@ref(eq:M2PL-formulation) induces a bijective relationship between
their two sets of respective bases.
Explicitly, if $`r TRAIT_VECTOR`$ is represented in basis $`r LS_BASIS`$
with inner product Gram matrix $`r INNER_PROD_MATRIX`$,
$`r DISCR_VECTOR`$ is represented in basis $`r TEST_SPACE_BASIS`$
with inner product Gram matrix $`r INNER_PROD_MATRIX_INV`$,
for any pair of bases $`r LS_BASIS`$ and $`r TEST_SPACE_BASIS`$.
Only when the two bases are orthonormal,
the two spaces share a common inner product (i.e., the dot product),
and thus can be mistaken.
However, it is worth noting that, although their representation
can be superimposed in this case,
they are still two different spaces.

We make a few observations here.
First, the transformation to the orthonormal bases of the two spaces allows
mapping the $`r MODEL_ACRONYM`$ parameters interchangeably in the two spaces,
by projecting one space onto the other.
This allows representing the coordinates of the discrimination vectors
in the latent space and, conversely,
the coordinates of the latent trait vectors in the test space.
As we can see, the invariance of the model holds,
no matter in which space we represent the coordinates.
Second, and most importantly,
given that the test space is defined as the set of item parameters
(see section *Test Space Definition*),
then they should be represented in this space, and not in the latent space.
Therefore, we may find the direction angles of $`r DISCR_VECTOR`$
in the test space:
Applying Proposition 1, if $`r ANGLE_VEC_TS_ITEM`$ is
the vector of direction angles of $`r DISCR_VECTOR`$,
in the test space $`r TEST_SPACE`$ we get

\begin{equation}
  `r DIR_COS_ITEM_VEC_TS_EQ`,                      (\#eq:dir-cos-vec-test-space)
\end{equation}

with $`r DIAG_MATRIX_INNER_PROD_INV`$ a diagonal matrix where
$`r MATRIX_INNER_PROD_INV_EL_DIAG_EQ`$.
As we will see later, this representation is very convenient, as
the direction of the item vectors with respect to the coordinate axes
has a direct, meaningful interpretation.

# Generalized Multidimensional Parameters

The item location $`r MIL_PARAM`$ is defined as the distance and direction
from the origin to the point of maximum slope [@reckase_difficulty_1985].
By analogy with the unidimensional case, $`r MDISC_SYM`$ is defined as
$4 `r SLOPE_MAX_PARAM`$ [@reckase_discriminating_1991].
Hence we may define the $`r MIL_PARAM`$ and $`r MDISC_SYM`$ using
Equations \@ref(eq:distance-param) through \@ref(eq:dir-cos-vec-test-space).
However, as they depend on the inner product matrix $`r INNER_PROD_MATRIX`$,
the choice we make of this matrix will lead us to different definitions of
the parameters.

## Agnostic Version

Up to this point,
we have derived the maximum slope and its location in the latent space
$`r LATENT_SPACE`$ independently of its basis $`r LS_BASIS`$.
If we assume that $`r LS_BASIS`$ is orthonormal, i.e., $`r BASIS_EQ`$,
$`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX`$ will also be orthonormal
and thus $`r INNER_PROD_MAT_STD_EQ`$.
In such a case the multidimensional item location and discrimination simplify
to the expressions derived by @reckase_difficulty_1985
and @reckase_discriminating_1991.
As these expressions implicitly assume the orthonormality of $`r LS_BASIS`$,
which bears no meaning besides its pure algebraic purpose,
we shall refer to them as the *agnostic* version of the parameters:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    `r MDISC_AG_PARAM_EQ` \\
    `r MIL_AG_PARAM_EQ`.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

## Covariance-Based Version

On the other hand, we can let the geometrical representation of
the latent space $`r LATENT_SPACE`$ account for its covariance structure,
thus giving $`r LS_BASIS`$ a statistical meaning
in the context of our MIRT modeling approach.
To do that, we may assume that $`r TRAIT_COORDS`$ is
a random vector distributed with covariance $`r COV_MATRIX_EQ`$,
being $`r COV_MATRIX`$ an $`r N_DIMS`$-dimensional positive definite matrix,
$`r CORR_MATRIX`$ its corresponding correlation matrix
(also positive definite) and $`r SD_MATRIX`$ a scaling diagonal matrix
with $`r VAR_COV_EQ`$ (i.e., the variances).

To make the representation of $`r LATENT_SPACE`$ meaningful,
the axes in $`r LS_BASIS`$ must have
an interpretation in terms of the latent space structure.
Although we do not know, in principle, what
the interpretation of a latent space basis should be, we may assume that
it must be somewhat related to the covariance structure.
Therefore, an orthonormal basis should represent independent,
standard coordinates;
formally, if $`r COV_MATRIX_ORTH`$ is the covariance matrix of
$`r TRAIT_ORTH_COORDS`$, then $`r COV_MATRIX_ORTH_EQ`$.
Applying Equation \@ref(eq:change-basis), $`r COV_MATRIX_TRANSF_EQ`$, and thus,

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    `r COV_MATRIX_TRANSF_ID_EQ`, \\
    `r COV_MATRIX_RESULT_EQ`.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

Therefore, we may define $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX`$ such that
$`r INNER_PROD_COV_COND`$;
in this case, $`r DIAG_MATRIX_INNER_PROD_INV_VAR_EQ`$,
resulting in the direction cosines defined by

\begin{equation}
  `r DIR_COS_VEC_COV_EQ`.                                 (\#eq:dir-cos-vec-cov)
\end{equation}

Along with the expressions for the $`r MDISC_SYM`$ and the signed distance,
this results in a *covariance-based* version of the parameters:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    `r MDISC_COV_PARAM_EQ` \\
    `r MIL_COV_PARAM_EQ`.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

According to @reckase_discriminating_1991, the multidimensional parameters must
meet three conditions for being regarded as a valid generalization
of the (unidimensional) IRT parameters:

1. If an item measures only dimension $`r DIM_INDEX`$,
   then $`r MDISC_UNIDIM_EQ`$.

2. The distance $`r DISTANCE_PARAM`$ has the same relationship with the
   intercept as $b_i$ in the unidimensional case,
   i.e., $`r DIST_INTERCEPT_REL`$.

3. $`r MDISC_SYM`$ is four times the maximum slope $`r SLOPE_MAX_PARAM`$.

The second property derives straightforwardly from
Equation \@ref(eq:distance-param),
and the third one is implicit in the definition of the $`r MDISC_SYM`$.
However, when an item measures only dimension $`r DIM_INDEX`$,
simple arithmetic can show that $`r MDISC_UNIDIM_GENERALIZED_EQ`$.
In the covariance-based case, this means that $`r MDISC_COV_BASED_UNIDIM_EQ`$
and, as $`r COV_SYM_DIAG`$ is generally different from 1,
$`r MDISC_COV_PARAM`$ does not fulfill the first property
(we shall refer to this property as *scale invariance*, henceforth).
Nevertheless, $`r MDISC_COV_PARAM`$ can be interpreted as
a *scaled version* of the parameter,
with the standard deviation of the corresponding dimension as scaling factor.
This transformation may be made in the unidimensional case as well,
thus finding a *standard-metric* discrimination parameter
(i.e., referred to a unitary variance space).
Moreover, it is important to notice that,
when the latent trait inner product Gram matrix
is defined as $`r INNER_PROD_COV_COND`$,
the norm of a trait vector in the latent space is given by
the Mahalanobis distance, i.e., $`r MAH_DIST_EQ`$ [@mahalanobis_reprint_2018].

## Correlation-Based Version

Despite $`r MDISC_COV_PARAM`$ not being scale-invariant,
we have argued that it is still a valid generalization of the IRT parameters.
However, it may be convenient to find yet another generalization,
one that accounts for the latent space structure
while still fulfilling this property.
To do this, let's assume a matrix $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_AUX_EQ`$, such that
$`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_AUX_RESULT`$.
Then, we have that

$$
  `r CORR_BASED_DERIVATION`.
$$

That is, defining $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX`$ as
$`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_CORR_BASED_DEF`$ can be interpreted as re-scaling
the transformed parameter back to its original metric.
In this case, we get that $`r INNER_PROD_CORR_COND`$.
Therefore, we can also define a *correlation-based* version of the
multidimensional parameters as

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    `r MDISC_CORR_PARAM_EQ` \\
    `r MIL_CORR_PARAM_EQ`.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

As we can see, this version also fulfills the scale invariance property,
as the $`r INNER_PROD_MAT_INV_DIAG_ELEMENT`$ elements are
the diagonal elements of $`r CORR_MATRIX`$, which are always equal to 1.
It is important to note though that this transformation does not have
another desirable property,
which we have used to justify the covariance-based version:
The $`r TRAIT_ORTH_COORDS`$ coordinates resulting from transforming
$`r TRAIT_COORDS`$ to the orthonormal basis $`r LS_ORTH_BASIS`$
are not generally uncorrelated, as one would expect
(save some exceptions, e.g., when all the variances are equal).
Nevertheless, it is important to note how the $`r MDISC_CORR_PARAM`$ accounts
for the correlation structure of the latent space
while still being scale invariant.
This will be very useful for the purpose of representing the items graphically,
as we will see later.

# Vector Representation

According to @ackerman_creating_1994, the most appropriate way of representing
multidimensional items is in vector form.
This allows representing several items altogether and analyzing them
in terms of their multidimensional parameters [@ackerman_graphical_1996].
An item vector will be applied at a direction and (signed) distance
from the origin of the coordinate system given by its $`r MIL_PARAM`$ parameter,
and will have a length equal to its $`r MDISC_SYM`$ parameter.
Its direction will also be given by the direction component of $`r MIL_PARAM`$,
so its orientation will always pass through the origin.
Based on these conditions, we need to compute
the origin and end coordinates of the vector,
denoted by $`r ORIGIN_ITEM_BASIS`$ and $`r END_ITEM_BASIS`$, respectively.

In an orthogonal basis it is easy to compute the coordinates,
as they are simply the orthogonal projections onto the corresponding axis.
In the oblique case it is not so simple though, but we can take advantage of the
orthornormalization introduced above.
In basis $`r TEST_SPACE_STD_BASIS`$, the origin and end coordinates are
$`r ORIGIN_ORTH_EQ`$ and $`r END_ORTH_EQ`$, respectively,
and they correspond to the coordinates in $`r TEST_SPACE_BASIS`$ transformed
according to Equation \@ref(eq:discr-vector-std),
i.e., $`r ORIGIN_TRANSF_EQ`$ and $`r END_TRANSF_EQ`$.
Applying Proposition 2 in the test space, we have that

\begin{equation}
  `r DIR_COS_ITEM_EQ`.
\end{equation}

Therefore, the coordinates result in

\begin{equation}
  `r ORIGIN_ITEM_COORDS_EQ`                          (\#eq:origin-coords-result)
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
  `r END_ITEM_COORDS_EQ`.                               (\#eq:end-coords-result)
\end{equation}

Equations \@ref(eq:origin-coords-result) and \@ref(eq:end-coords-result)
express the item coordinates in terms of their multidimensional parameters.
However, it is worth noting that the latent space Gram matrix
also plays a role in computing these coordinates,
and will therefore have an effect on the representation.
Of course,
from Equations \@ref(eq:origin-coords-result) and \@ref(eq:end-coords-result),
it is easy to express the coordinates in terms of the parameters in the original
model formulation.
Given $`r DISCR_VECTOR_COORDS_EQ`$,
we can express the coordinates in terms of the model parameters as

\begin{align}
  `r ORIGIN_ITEM_PARAMS_EQ`                  &(\#eq:origin-from-model-params) \\
  `r END_ITEM_PARAMS_EQ`.                    &(\#eq:end-from-model-params)
\end{align}

However, formulating them in terms of the multidimensional parameters allows
studying the items in terms of their multidimensional properties.
In the following, we see how to geometrically interpret
these multidimensional parameters.

## Geometric Properties of the Items

We have seen how the two new versions of the parameters fulfill
the three conditions proposed by @reckase_discriminating_1991
for valid generalizations of the IRT parameters to the multidimensional case,
being the scale invariance of the $`r MDISC_COV_PARAM`$ the only exception.
From a geometrical perspective, the item $`r MDISC_SYM`$ is simply interpreted
as the length of its corresponding vector.
Regarding the $`r MIL_PARAM`$ parameter,
we will consider now two more properties, related to each of its two components:
the distance to the origin, and the measurement direction.

The (signed) distance to the origin,
given by the first component of $`r MIL_PARAM`$, has an interesting property:
By the definition of the inner product,
$`r MDISC_SYM`$ is strictly positive for non-null vectors.
Therefore, the sign of $`r DISTANCE_PARAM`$ is equal to
the sign of $`r INTERCEPT_PARAM`$.
The implication is that the item is displaced along
its measurement direction forward or backward with respect to the origin.
As the $`r MDISC_SYM`$ appears in the denominator of $`r DISTANCE_PARAM`$,
that displacement will be inversely proportional
to the discrimination of the item.
That is, the less discriminating the item is,
the further away it will be from the origin.
Of course, it is also directly proportional to
the intercept parameter $`r INTERCEPT_PARAM`$.
This implies that, if $`r INTERCEPT_NULL_EQ`$, $`r DISTANCE_NULL_EQ`$ as well,
regardless of the multidimensional discrimination.

The measurement direction is given by
the signs of $`r DIR_COS_ITEM_VEC_BASIS_TS`$ which,
also due to the strict positiveness of $`r MDISC_SYM`$,
are equal to the signs of $`r DISCR_VECTOR`$.
This property leads directly to generalizing
the parameters to the monotonically non-increasing case:
The measurement direction relative to dimension $`r DIM_INDEX`$
will be negative when $`r IRF_ABBR`$ is monotonically decreasing
with respect to variations along $`r TRAIT_COMPONENT`$.
When $`r IRF_ABBR`$ is constant
with respect to variations along $`r TRAIT_COMPONENT`$,
$`r SIGN_COS_VEC_ITEM_EQ`$,
which means that $`r MIL_PARAM`$ is orthogonal to the $`r DIM_INDEX`$-th axis.
However, note that this does not necessarily imply that
the vector is parallel to any other axis
(or strictly contained in the hyperplane formed by other axes, for that matter);
this will always be true for the $`r MIL_AG_PARAM`$ due to
the orthogonality assumption,
but it will depend on the correlation matrix $`r CORR_MATRIX`$
for the other two versions of the parameter.

# Graphical Representation

The geometric properties are easier to apprehend with
a visual representation of the items.
To do that, we need to choose a version of the parameters
that yields their most faithful representation.
We have already seen that
the agnostic version disregards the latent space structure.
Therefore, it will only be useful in the unlikely case that
we have no information of such structure.
When we have an estimate of the latent space covariances,
we may use either the covariance-based or the correlation-based version.
However, we have already seen how
the distance to the origin depends on the $`r MDISC_SYM`$.
Also, in the covariance-based,
the term $`r INNER_PROD_MAT_DIAG_INV_PROD`$ becomes $`r COV_BASED_SCALE_MAT_EQ`$
which, as we have argued before, implies a change of scale.
In the case of the correlation-based version, however,
$`r INNER_PROD_MAT_DIAG_INV_PROD`$ is simply $`r CORR_MATRIX_INV`$,
being the coordinates scale-invariant.
For graphical representation purposes,
the correlation-based version will thus be preferred.

Plotting on a display usually requires providing
coordinates in a rectangular Cartesian system.
Therefore, we must compute the equivalent rectangular coordinates
of our general, possibly non-rectangular coordinates.
This implies pre-multiplying its coordinates in basis $`r TEST_SPACE_BASIS`$
by $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_TRANSP_INV`$, to find
the equivalent, orthonormalized coordinates.
Hence, we will need a convenient value for $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_TRANSP_INV`$
that allows us to represent the test space structure and the items
in a rectangular Cartesian system.

The general procedure for plotting an item $`r ITEM_INDEX`$ consists of
the following steps:

1. Compute $`r MDISC_CORR_PARAM_ITEM`$ and $`r MIL_CORR_PARAM_ITEM`$,
   the item $`r MDISC_CORR_PARAM`$ and $`r MIL_CORR_PARAM`$ parameters,
   respectively.

1. Compute the origin coordinates $`r ORIGIN_ITEM_EQ`$, with
   $`r DISTANCE_CORR_PARAM`$ and $`r DIR_CORR_PARAM`$ the distance and direction
   component, respectively, of $`r MIL_CORR_PARAM_ITEM`$.

1. Compute the end coordinates $`r END_ITEM_EQ`$.

1. Define $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_TRANSP_INV`$ such that
   $`r TRANSF_MATRIX_INV_SQ_CORR_EQ`$.

1. Compute the rectangular coordinates
   $`r ORIGIN_ITEM_ORTH`$ and $`r END_ITEM_ORTH`$ by pre-multiplying
   $`r ORIGIN_ITEM_BASIS`$ and $`r END_ITEM_BASIS`$, respectively, by
   the transformation matrix $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_TRANSP_INV`$
   ($`r ORIGIN_TRANSF_EQ`$; $`r END_TRANSF_EQ`$).

Instead of steps 1 to 3,
one can alternatively compute $`r ORIGIN_ITEM_BASIS`$ and $`r END_ITEM_BASIS`$
directly from Equations \@ref(eq:origin-from-model-params)
and \@ref(eq:end-from-model-params).
Note though that these equations are not independent of $`r CORR_MATRIX`$,
as it is used in the computation of $`r DISCR_VECTOR_MODULE`$,
and thus this matrix is necessary in any case to compute the coordinates.

Up to now, all our derivations have considered $`r N_DIMS`$-dimensional spaces;
that is, multidimensional parameters and item vector coordinates
can be computed in an arbitrary large number of dimensions.
However, as plotting more than two dimensions
is difficult on a bidimensional display
(and hardly possible at all for more than three dimensions with the
currently available technology),
we limit ourselves to the bidimensional case here.
The example in Figure \@ref(fig:item-plot-out) showcases a representation of
a set of items in two different bidimensional spaces.
In the first case, the two latent dimensions are independent,
with $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_TRANSP_INV`$ being an identity matrix.
In the second one, the correlation between the dimensions is $`r CORR_OBL_OUT`$.
To keep the horizontal axis invariant,
we define $`r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_TRANSP_INV`$ such that
it only rotates the vertical axis [@harman_modern_1976]:

\begin{equation}
  `r TRANSFORM_MATRIX_EXAMPLE_EQ`.
\end{equation}

The sample items have the same `r MODEL_ACRONYM` parameters
in both test spaces.
However, their multidimensional parameters differ due to the correlation among
the latent dimensions.
The parameters in both spaces,
along with their corresponding `r MODEL_ACRONYM` parameters,
are shown in Table \@ref(tab:example-items-table-out).

Figure \@ref(fig:item-plot-out) illustrates the effect of
a positive correlation on the $`r MDISC_CORR_PARAM`$
(and consequently the $`r MIL_CORR_PARAM`$) value:
The components of the discrimination parameters tend to
*sum up* in the same direction as they get *more aligned*.
Thus, if the discrimination parameters have the same sign, as in items 1 and 5,
the $`r MDISC_CORR_PARAM_ITEM`$ value tends to increase;
on the contrary, when the discrimination parameters have opposite signs
they tend to cancel each other out and $`r MDISC_CORR_PARAM_ITEM`$ decreases,
as happens with items 2 and 3.
This effect can be especially noticed by comparing
the $`r MDISC_CORR_PARAM_ITEM`$ of items 3 and 5:
Their discrimination parameters are equal in absolute value,
so their $`r MDISC_CORR_PARAM_ITEM`$ values are equal in the orthogonal space;
however, the effect of the correlation shrinks the former and
stretches the latter.
Finally, note that item 4 has one discrimination parameter equal to 0,
so its $`r MDISC_CORR_PARAM_ITEM`$ is unaffected by the correlation.

a standard bivariate normal distribution, with null correlation (a),
or with correlation $`r CORR_OBL_OUT`$ (b-d).
The contour plots represent the `r contour_breaks_out` of the maximum density,
from outer to inner, respectively.
:::

We can also see how the sign of $`r INTERCEPT_PARAM`$ affects
the distance to the origin:
The item vector is applied at the origin when its value is null (item 1),
and tends to be shifted
*against* the item direction when its value is positive (items 2 and 4) and
*towards* the item direction when it is negative (items 3 and 5).
Finally, we can see how the direction is determined by the discrimination
parameters *and* the correlation; the sign of the discrimination parameters
determines where the item will point at;
thus, an item with two positive (negative) discrimination parameters will point
at the first (third) quadrant,
while an item with opposite-sign discrimination parameters will be in the
second or fourth quadrant.
The direction relative to the axes will be given by the relative absolute value
of the two parameters, but also by the correlation:
Items 2 and 3 especially illustrate this effect,
as each of them is orthogonal to one of the axes in the oblique space,
even when they are not parallel to the other axis.

# Application to Examples From the Literature

In the following, we apply our results to two instances taken from
the MIRT literature.
The first one draws from a classic example by @reckase_multidimensional_2009,
who presents a three-dimensional instrument made up by 30 items.
It is supposed to be a cognitive test
(it is unclear whether the item parameters are estimated from
actual empirical data, or they are a fictional example,
created ad hoc for simulation purposes),
so all the discrimination parameters are positive.
The second example, taken from @tezza_modelo_2018, is an application of
the `r MODEL_ACRONYM` to assess the quality of e-commerce websites.
Besides being an empirical example, applied to actual test data,
it pertains to the non-cognitive domain and contains
items with  negative discrimination parameters.
This is convenient for exemplifying our results with
items with opposite-sign discrimination parameters.

The two examples are represented in Tables
\@ref(tab:empirical-table-Reckase2009-out)
and \@ref(tab:empirical-table-Tezza2018-out), respectively.
Each of these tables shows the original `r MODEL_ACRONYM` parameters
[the estimation errors in @tezza_modelo_2018 are omitted for clarity],
along with the agnostic version of the multidimensional parameters;
the $`r MDISC_AG_PARAM`$ and the $`r DISTANCE_AG_PARAM`$
are coincident with their respective original sources
[see Table 6.1 in @reckase_multidimensional_2009, p. 153; and
Table 5 in @tezza_modelo_2018, p. 926].
In the first case, the direction angles are also coincident with the values
provided in the original [@tezza_modelo_2018, do not provide these results].
In order to facilitate the comparison,
the covariance-based version of each parameter is provided in
the column next to its corresponding agnostic version.

Table \@ref(tab:empirical-table-Reckase2009-out) shows the parameters of the
30-item test in the @reckase_multidimensional_2009 example:
There are three ten-item blocks assumed to approximate
a simple structure: Items 1-10 measure dimension 1, items 11-20 dimension 3,
and items 21-30 dimension 2
[see Table 6.1, p. 153, in @reckase_multidimensional_2009].
In his example, Reckase tests the estimation of these items
on two simulated datasets: In the first one, the latent trait distribution
is standard with null correlations; however, the second one has

\begin{equation}
  `r cov_matrix_value_out`,
\end{equation}

as covariance matrix, which corresponds to a correlation matrix of

\begin{equation}
  `r cor_matrix_value_out`.
\end{equation}

As we can see in Table \@ref(tab:empirical-table-Reckase2009-out),
the agnostic versions of the multidimensional parameters
(columns labelled _`r AGNOSTIC_ABBR`_)
coincide with Reckase's columns A, B, and $\alpha_1$ to $\alpha_3$.
However, when we consider the latent space structure
(columns labelled $`r COV_MATRIX`$), we notice several differences.
First, the $`r MDISC_ITEM`$ parameters tend to be larger
than their agnostic counterparts.
This happens because all the discrimination parameters and the latent space
correlations are positive; in this respect, these items are similar to item 1
in Table \@ref(tab:example-items-table-out) and Figure \@ref(fig:item-plot-out).
However, for the items mostly aligned with dimension 2 (items 21-30), as the
$`r MDISC_ITEM`$ parameters are also scaled by a standard deviation smaller
than 1, their values decrease, being some of them smaller than the agnostic
versions. The $`r DISTANCE_PARAM`$ parameters decrease or increase, consequently
(see Equation \@ref(eq:M2PL-formula-polar)), thus being most of them smaller
than the agnostic ones (again, with the exceptions only happening
in the items aligned with dimension 2).
Finally, we see that the direction angles are not as clearly separated as one
might expect from the agnostic versions. This effect is more pronounced among
the items aligned with dimensions 1 and 3, which are strongly correlated.
In this situation, we notice that the angles tend to be much smaller, as the
high correlation induces an alignment between the two dimensions
(compare item 1 in the two test spaces in
Table \@ref(tab:example-items-table-out) and Figure \@ref(fig:item-plot-out)).

The latter effect can be better noticed in another case, in which Reckase
uses the same item parameters to demonstrate the over-specification of
dimensions (see p. 183).
In that example, he uses a covariance matrix that practically has rank 1,
implying that the (alleged) three latent dimensions collapse into a single one.
This makes the latent space unidimensional in practice,
which in turn restricts the dimensionality of any response dataset
generated from a test measuring those traits.
Therefore, "the data could be well fit by a unidimensional IRT model"
[@reckase_multidimensional_2009, p. 189].
In such a case, when all the items are strictly aligned with
the one dimension being measured,
we should expect the direction angles to be extremely close to 0 for all items.
The reader interested can check that this is the case for
the covariance-based version of the direction angles
in the table in Online Resource 1.

## @tezza_modelo_2018

@tezza_modelo_2018 provide us with another example that showcases
the effect of correlated dimensions on negative discrimination parameters.
In their model, dimensions 1 and 4 are estimated to have a correlation of
`r DIMS_CORR`.
With this latent space structure, items that strongly discriminate in either or
both of these two dimensions change drastically their multidimensional
parameters from the agnostic to the covariance-based version
(see Table \@ref(tab:empirical-table-Tezza2018-out))
---this happens,
for example, with items 57 and 60. These items also have different-sign
discrimination parameters in dimensions 1 and 4, so their situation is
similar to items 2 and 3 in Table \@ref(tab:example-items-table-out) and
Figure \@ref(fig:item-plot-out),
thus the decrease in their $`r MDISC_ITEM`$ parameter.
The effect on the direction is also apparent in the angles these items make with
these dimensions, which change up to almost 20º, compared with at most 7º in the
other two dimensions, and around 1º in most cases.

On the other hand, cases such as items 12 or 59, which have
relatively low discrimination parameters on those two dimensions
(compared with the ones in dimension 2 and 3, respectively) are barely affected.
The most extreme change in these two examples occurs in
the direction of item 12 with respect to dimension 4. We see how the large
discrimination in dimension 1, when combined with the correlation
with dimension 4, induces a decrease in the angular direction
with that dimension.
In this case, because the discrimination in dimension 4 so low, the situation is
very similar to item 4 in Table \@ref(tab:example-items-table-out)
and Figure \@ref(fig:item-plot-out).

# Discussion

@reckase_difficulty_1985 proposed a definition of the $`r MIL_PARAM`$ parameter
general enough to "be used with any model that yields probabilities that
increase monotonically with an increase in ability on any dimension" (p. 411).
However, this definition implicitly assumes
the orthonormality of the latent space.
Applying the general procedure outlined by @reckase_difficulty_1985 and later
extended by @reckase_discriminating_1991
we have obtained a set of multidimensional parameters
that generalize the original results in two aspects:
(1) to a non-orthonormal space that accounts for the covariance structure of
the multivariate latent variable, and
(2) to any case of unchanging monotonicity.
The latter may seem superfluous, given that several examples in the literature
already make use of this generalization
[e.g., the one we have used to illustrate it: @tezza_modelo_2018].
However, this generalization had never been formalized, up to now.
Therefore, we highlight here the interest of showing how
the item psychometric properties are paralleled by their geometrical properties,
and how this holds for any case of unchanging monotony
of the item response function.
Regarding the first generalization,
it is worth noting that @zhang_theoretical_1999 already proposed a formulation
of the $`r MDISC_SYM`$ equivalent to our covariance-based version,
but for a more general, semi-parametric formulation
(although constrained to non-decreasing monotony).
However, they provided no formal proof for this result either.
Our results provide this formal derivation, although only for the specific
case of the `r MODEL_ACRONYM` model.

As we have seen, taking the latent space structure into account may have a
substantial effect in the resulting values and interpretation of the parameters,
something not contemplated by the original
(hereby referred to as agnostic) version.
Moreover, in applications where the latent space structure is critical
(e.g., multi-group IRT, equating, and linking),
the agnostic version may overlook relevant differences in
the values of the multidimensional parameters.
Different covariance structures across groups may significantly affect
the value of these parameters,
due to differences in either the variances or the correlation structure.
Therefore, even when the model parameters are equal across groups,
the multidimensional parameters may not be the same
if the covariance structure differs across groups.
Conversely, the same multidimensional parameters may correspond
to different parameter models.
The subsequent invariance of either the M2PL parameters
or the multidimensional ones may lead to different interpretations of
the same model when applied to different groups.
Although this is an empirical question that requires further research,
it could have significant implications for future theoretical developments
in the understanding of MIRT theory.

With that purpose in mind, we have defined two new versions of these parameters:
One that takes into account the whole covariance structure,
and another one that only considers the correlations among latent dimensions.
The covariance-based parameters have the drawback of not fulfilling
the first of Reckase & McKinley's [-@reckase_discriminating_1991] properties,
namely, the scale invariance property.
However, we have provided a rationale for the violation of this property,
arguing that it is also paralleled in unidimensional IRT.
Given its equivalence to the inner product definition in a space with
an identity covariance matrix,
it also refers the item parameters to an orthonormal metric,
comparable among different latent spaces.
More importantly, the covariance-based version
of the multidimensional parameters is invariant to
changes of latent-space basis.
Once again, this is relevant in applications where
potentially different bases are involved.
Furthermore, we have found that using this version yields a norm in
the latent space given by the Mahalanobis distance.
This statistical distance not only takes
the latent covariance structure into account,
but also makes the latent space norm invariant to changes of basis.
Given these considerations,
we propose adopting the covariance-based version of
the multidimensional parameters as the most general definition,
and refer to them simply as
the $`r MDISC_SYM`$ and $`r MIL_PARAM`$ parameters.
The correlation-based version, on the other hand,
has the advantage of being scale-invariant,
which is convenient for fidelity when representing the items.
However, as it has been defined ad hoc to fulfill this specific property,
it lacks the other desirable ones the covariance-based version has
(i.e., norm invariance, and yielding a diagonal latent covariance matrix in
the corresponding orthogonal basis).
Therefore, we recommend its use for graphical representation purposes only,
although in many applications both versions will be coincident, fortunately.
As for the agnostic version, we recommend it only in
the (unlikely) case of having no information about the latent space structure,
or when such structure is irrelevant
(e.g., plotting the discrimination parameters for interpretation purposes).

One may consider that the formal derivations presented here are
overly complicated,
when one might simply transform the space to rectangular Cartesian coordinates
with Equations \@ref(eq:change-basis) and \@ref(eq:discr-vector-std) and
then compute the parameters in the transformed space using
Reckase's [-@reckase_difficulty_1985] and
Reckase & McKinley's [-@reckase_discriminating_1991] procedure.
After all, interpreting the axes of this space as substantive latent traits
depends on "the distinction between coordinate axes and the constructs that are
the target of the instrument"
(Reckase, M.D., personal communication, 28 April 2015).
Such a procedure will of course yield identical results,
given the invariance of $`r MDISC_COV_PARAM`$ to a change of basis.
However, the computations in the oblique space allow us to obtain
the direction cosines relative to the original latent dimensions,
which may give relevant information if these are actual, substantive traits.
Computing the parameters in the orthonormalized (or just orthogonalized) space,
by contrast, would require transforming the cosines to
the original, non-orthonormal basis afterwards.
Nevertheless, most available MIRT software solutions,
such as flexMIRT [@cai_flexmirt_2024], IRTPRO [@cai_irtpro_2017],
or R package {mirt} [@chalmers_mirt_2012],
initially estimate an uncorrelated solution (at least in the exploratory case)
and apply an oblique rotation afterwards.
Taking advantage of the invariance property,
we may compute the parameters in the orthogonal space
(in fact, this is exactly what {mirt} functions `MDISC()` and `MDIFF()` do).
Then, we may compute the direction cosines in the rotated solution by applying
Equation \@ref(eq:dir-cos-vec-cov).
What a test practitioner should be aware of, though,
is that applying Reckase & McKinley's [-@reckase_discriminating_1991] formula
after any non-orthonormal transformation will yield
a $`r MDISC_AG_PARAM`$ value specific to that basis,
unlike the invariant value of $`r MDISC_COV_PARAM`$.

On the other hand, establishing the relationship between the original and
the orthonormalized basis has provided us with an important insight:
The distinction between the latent space and the test space.
Our derivations show that, to properly represent the items,
we need to define a vector space that has
the latent covariance (or correlation) matrix as its inner product matrix.
On the other hand, the latent space,
where the person parameters are represented,
has the inverse of the covariance (correlation) matrix as
its inner product matrix.
[Note that in the original derivations by @reckase_difficulty_1985;
and @reckase_discriminating_1991, both matrices simplify to the identity matrix,
so there was no need to make this distinction.]
This implies that the axes defined by the test space basis,
and not the ones defined by the latent space basis,
are a geometrical representation of the covariance structure.
Indeed, the cosines of the angles among the test space axes are
the geometric equivalent of the correlations.
This result is both surprising and counterintuitive
---Several instances in the MIRT literature suggest that
"the angle between the axes [of the latent ability space] represents
the degree of correlation" [@ackerman_multidimensional_2005-1, p. 16].
We hope our results help shed a clearer light on
this often misunderstood topic.

It is worth noting that a similar relationship exists in
the common factor literature
between the *primary factors* and Thurstone's *reference axes*
[@harman_modern_1976, see p. 276].
Nevertheless, one must not make the mistake of assimilating the test space and
the *common-factor space*.
Their parameterization, albeit related [@mcdonald_test_1999], is different,
and we do not mean to imply that the derivations made here are directly
generalizable to the common factor model.
Those relationships deserve further exploration on their own.

Making a distinction between the two spaces can also have a significant impact
on our understanding of MIRT applications that involve several latent spaces,
such as multi-group equating and linking.
Although the usual transformations among coordinate systems still apply
under this consideration
[see Chapter 8 of @reckase_multidimensional_2009,
for an exhaustive discussion on the topic],
the different geometric bases on which each of the two spaces is represented
must be considered.
However, as they are mutually dependent,
any transformation in any of the two spaces will imply
the inverse transformation in the other one,
thus preserving the relationship between the two spaces.
Nevertheless, using non-orthogonal rotation matrices for aligning the items
(in a common-item design procedure) or persons
[in a common-person one, see Chapter 9 in @reckase_multidimensional_2009]
may have additional implications;
for example, besides a rescaling and an origin translation, a transformation
as defined, e.g., in Equation (8.31) of @reckase_multidimensional_2009,
may imply a rotation that can be non-orthogonal,
thus affecting the relative alignment among the test space axes,
and subsequently among the latent space ones.
Moreover, even if the transformation in one space is scale-invariant
(i.e., the transform matrix has unitary diagonal elements),
it may induce a rescaling in the other one,
given by the diagonal elements of the inverse transform matrix.
These implications will require future exploration of
the relationships between the latent and test spaces
as mathematically separate entities.

Finally, we must also warn against generalizing these results
to other IRT models without further consideration.
First, we have only considered the case of dichotomous items,
whereas non-cognitive applications often (and sometimes cognitive ones as well)
require modeling several response categories.
Although proposals such as the graded-scale [@samejima_estimation_1968] and
the nominal response [@bock_estimating_1972] models are closely related to
the 2-parameter logistic model, it would be hasty to assume that these
parameters generalize in any way to
the multidimensional versions of those models without a formal proof.
The same can be said from the multidimensional parameters of other models
for dichotomous items different from the `r MODEL_ACRONYM` model.
We expect this work to help set the foundations for investigating those
generalizations.
Hopefully, this will contribute to a better understanding
of the underlying multidimensional measurement theory, its implications,
and its interpretation.
