MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH;https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&journalCode=hmbr20;3.085;SSCI;SOCIAL SCIENCES, MATHEMATICAL METHODS;Q1;"Multivariate Behavioral Research is the flagship journal of the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology (SMEP). It is a journal devoted to the dissemination, evaluation, and application of quantitative methods to the behavioral sciences and. It aims to publish articles intended to cater to a wide audience of quantitative methodologists and substantive researchers who wish to use advanced methods in their work. Its goal is to have a long-term transformative effect on research in psychology and the behavioral sciences.

The journal is the result of the joint effort of a team of Associate Editors and seeks four kinds of contributions:

Regular contributions are research articles that advance or evaluate current quantitative methods. They are judged by their accessibility to a wide audience, potential to change the field, and innovativeness. Regardless of content, they are to include a numerical analysis to showcase the relevance of their contribution.";;NO;Q1 in JCR;3
EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT;https://journals.sagepub.com/aims-scope/EPM;3.088;SSCI;PSYCHOLOGY, MATHEMATICAL;Q1;Educational and Psychological Measurement publishes referred scholarly work from all academic disciplines interested in the study of measurement theory, problems, and issues. Theoretical articles will address new developments and techniques, and applied articles will deal strictly with innovation applications.;;NO;Q1 in JCR;1
PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW;https://www.springer.com/journal/13423;4.412;SSCI;PSYCHOLOGY, MATHEMATICAL;Q1;The journal provides coverage spanning a broad spectrum of topics in all areas of experimental psychology, intended for a general readership. The journal is primarily dedicated to the publication of theory and review articles and brief reports of outstanding experimental work. Areas of coverage include attention and perception, cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics, behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, memory, comparative psychology, social cognition, and cognitive development.;Psychometrics not explicitly mentioned;;Q1 in JCR;
Behavior Research Methods;https://www.springer.com/journal/13428;5.953;SSCI;PSYCHOLOGY, MATHEMATICAL;Q1;The journal Behavior Research Methods publishes articles concerned with the methods, techniques, and instrumentation of research in experimental psychology. The journal focuses particularly on the use of computer technology in psychological research. An annual special issue is devoted to this field.;Psychometrics not explicitly mentioned;;Q1 in JCR;
BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/20448317/homepage/productinformation.html;2.41;SSCI;PSYCHOLOGY, MATHEMATICAL;Q2;"The British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology publishes articles relating to areas of psychology which have a greater mathematical or statistical aspect of their argument than is usually acceptable to other journals including:

? mathematical psychology
? statistics
? psychometrics
? decision making
? psychophysics
? classification
? relevant areas of mathematics, computing and computer software

These include articles that address substantitive psychological issues or that develop and extend techniques useful to psychologists. New models for psychological processes, new approaches to existing data, critiques of existing models and improved algorithms for estimating the parameters of a model are examples of articles which may be favoured.";Articles skimmed through do not seem to be too strict with theorems and derivations. Reviewing Ip (2010) I see lemmas.;;Suggested by Mario;
PSYCHOMETRIKA;https://www.springer.com/journal/11336/aims-and-scope;2.29;SSCI;PSYCHOLOGY, MATHEMATICAL;Q2;"Psychometrika, the official journal of the Psychometric Society, is devoted to the development of psychology as a quantitative rational science. Articles examine statistical methods, discuss mathematical techniques, and advance theory for evaluating behavioral data in psychology, education, and the social and behavioral sciences generally. There are three main sections in Psychometrika: Theory and Methods, Application Reviews and Case Studies (ARCS), and Book Reviews. Additionally, there is a section online for software, data, and other electronic supplementary material for the articles in these sections.

Theory and Methods is the primary section, and it contains articles that present original research on the development of quantitative models for psychological phenomena, and on quantitative methodology in the social and behavioral sciences, including new mathematical and statistical techniques for the evaluation of psychological data and the application of such techniques.";Maybe too theoretical?;;Q2 in JCR;2
JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS;https://journals.sagepub.com/aims-scope/JEB;2.116;SSCI;PSYCHOLOGY, MATHEMATICAL;Q2;Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, sponsored jointly by the American Educational Research Association and the American Statistical Association, publishes articles that are original and provide methods that are useful to those studying problems and issues in educational or behavioral research. Typical papers introduce new methods of analysis, provide properties of these methods, and an example of use in education or behavioral research. Critical reviews of current practice, tutorial presentations of less well-known methods, and novel applications of already-known methods are also of interest. Papers discussing statistical techniques without specific educational or behavioral interest or focusing on substantive results without developing new statistical methods or models or making novel use of existing methods have lower priority. Simulation studies, either to demonstrate properties of an existing method or to compare several existing methods (without providing a new method), also have low priority.;"Our paper might be regarded as ""without specific educational of behavioral interest""?";;Q2 in JCR;3
